				Westlaw is an online legal research service for lawyers and legal professionals in the United States and is a product of Thomson Reuters. 
				In addition, it provides proprietary database services. Information resources on Westlaw include more than 40,000 databases of case law, 
				state and federal statutes, administrative codes, newspaper and magazine articles, public records, law journals, law reviews, treatises, 
				legal forms and other information resources.
			</P>
			<P>
				Westlaw site uses various applications to fetch data from various courts (Supreme Court, appellate courts, bankruptcy court, District Courts, 
				Federal courts), process them, and display the entire case with its history. Smart proxy being one of the applications is the initial application
				which pulls out the data from variould courts in the United States. WestLaw publishes the court verdicts, rules or amendments passed 
				by the courts in less than 10 minutes after it being passed at the courts. The published data will have inline links to various other related 
				cases or articles or other necessary information.
			</P>
			<p>
				Smart Praxy is one of the major application which acts as the start point for the entire westlaw.com life cycle.
				The raw file that are generated from each court in the United States are first picked up by the Smart Proxy application. 
				The raw file received could be in varioud formats. Each file format is handled seperately and sent for further processing 
				in the workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				The files from various courts would be FTPd to a specific path to which the Smart Proxy would be listening to. Once a file
				is placed in the designated path, the file would be immediately picked and processed without delays.
			</p>
			<p>
				Developed a workflow to process the Spreme Court documents that required setting up a new FTP path, new implementation to
				process the raw document, and send it for further processing before it is displayed in westlaw.com
