				This project aims at the timely discovery of any activity that jeopardizes the integrity, availability, 
				or the confidentiality of an IT system. It is often approached as a classification task, which aims at spotting the 
				appearance of either a known pattern of system misuse or an anomaly in system (or application) behavior. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on the activity it observes, an intrusion detection system (IDS) may be either of three types: host, network, 
				or application. A host IDS is usually set to audit the functionality of the underlying operating system, as it executes system calls, 
				but can also be set to watch critical resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on the classification scheme, an IDS is either misuse or anomaly. Misuse detection takes a collection of signatures of 
				previous intrusions or known vulnerabilities, and applies it to detect a new occurrence.
				While accurate, misuse IDSs is often unable to detect variants of known attacks, or attacks that exploit vulnerabilities 
				recently discovered. To get around this problem, an anomaly IDS counts on a characterization of ordinary activity and uses it to distinguish abnormal one.
			</p>
			<p>
				More often than not, commercial IDSs are bypassed, either by a zero-day attack or by an unseen variant of an existing attack, 
				called a mimicry attack. Then, it is necessary to analyze the vandalized IT system in order to determine how the intruder gained access 
				to it and what he did with it afterward. This analysis usually reveals that, 
				to break into the system, the attacker has run a small program, called an exploit, which has taken advantage of system vulnerability.

				<u>Algorithm</u><br>
				Step 1: Select the number of layers, n, for the complete
				system.<br>
				Step 2: Separately perform features selection for each layer.<br>
				Step 3: Train a separate model with CRFs for each layer
				using the features selected from Step 2.<br>
				Step 4: Plug in the trained models sequentially such that
				only the connections labeled as normal are passed
				to the next layer.<br>
				Step 5: For each (next) test instance perform Steps 6
				through 9.<br>
				Step 6: Test the instance and label it either as attack or
				normal.<br>
				Step 7: If the instance is labeled as attack, block it and
				identify it as an attack represented by the layer
				name at which it is detected and go to Step 5. Else
				pass the sequence to the next layer.<br>
				Step 8: If the current layer is not the last layer in the system,
				test the instance and go to Step 7. Else go to Step 9.<br>
				Step 9: Test the instance and label it either as normal or as
				an attack. If the instance is labeled as an attack,
				block it and identify
