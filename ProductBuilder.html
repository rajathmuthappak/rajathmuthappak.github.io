				Westlaw is an online legal research service for lawyers and legal professionals in the United States and is a product of Thomson Reuters. 
				In addition, it provides proprietary database services. Information resources on Westlaw include more than 40,000 databases of case law, 
				state and federal statutes, administrative codes, newspaper and magazine articles, public records, law journals, law reviews, treatises, 
				legal forms and other information resources.
			</P>
			<P>
				Westlaw site uses various applications to fetch data from various courts (Supreme Court, appellate courts, bankruptcy court, District Courts, 
				Federal courts), process them, and display the entire case with its history. Product Builder being one of the applications is the final 
				application the data goes through which combines multiple input files and the output of Product Builder is used for online display and also 
				for printing law books, references, and current legal dictionary editions. WestLaw publishes the court verdicts, rules or amendments passed 
				by the courts in less than 10 minutes after it being passed at the courts. The published data will have inline links to various other related 
				cases or articles or other necessary information.
			</P>
			<p>
				Product Builder is a web application that was build to transmform the raw AMPEX format file, which is a Thomson Reuters proprietary format, to  
				XML file basd on the set of rules set by the Business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The project involved eliminating the use of mainframe systems for intermediate data conversion from AMPEX to XML and forwarding the data file to the main repository
				which would be used to display the data file in westlaw.com. This project has saved Thomson Reuters millions of dollars and also elominating mainframe 
				system allowed the data to be displayed in Westlaw.com within few hours of the case's judgement was given.
